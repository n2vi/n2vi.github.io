*Train Bridge* is the defunct structure before the Dumbarton bridge
*Amphitheatre" is the two white conical structures towards Moffett Field NUQ

PAO tower often has permission to direct traffic in Moffett airspace, so especially keep your head on a swivel when turning base 31 during crowded times.
