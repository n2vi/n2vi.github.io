<EM>I believe people should be judged not by certificates, but by 
their contributions to the world.  However, people do ask about
affiliations to watch for appearance of conflict of interest or
to identify old classmates.  Fair enough.</EM>

Semi-retired, I still work on technical things but do not intend to have an employer or boss.
Mostly I'm working on building
<a href="nc3modernization.pdf">radically</a> simpler and more secure systems.
From time to time I advise startups like K2 Cyber Security, Stripe, and TerraTrue.
I also have time to spend on hobbies like flying my Cessna 182 around the country.

Retired March 2017 as Vice President at Google, responsible for Security and Privacy Engineering.  Obviously I'm biased, but I think Google Security Team is one of the finest groups anywhere.
I'm in awe of the things they accomplish.  Good thing, too, because we're stewards of data for billions of people and we have very skilled and persistent adversaries.
<p>
Before Google, 
I was technical lead on CloudControl, an
internal venture building a security product
for defending against unwanted network traffic.
Before that, I was head of the Secure Networking Research Department in the
<A HREF="/cm/cs/">Computing Sciences Research Center</A>
at <A HREF="http://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Laboratories</A> in Murray Hill, NJ.
I joined Bell Labs straight out of graduate school and was
happily there through many company changes.
Bell Labs is currently part of <a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/">Alcatel-Lucent</a>.
I retired in April 2007.
